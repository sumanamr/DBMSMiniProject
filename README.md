# DBMSMiniProject

Developed DBMS Mini project on Hostel Database Management. This is created for the admin who manages hostel. Admin allocates room to students, records all login details of students to hostel, records details of all visitors who visit students, and deallocates room to students in case the student is willing to vacate hostel.
